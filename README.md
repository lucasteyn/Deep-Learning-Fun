# Deep-Learning-Fun
This is code I used to demonstrate backpropagation using numpy. Please contact me with ideas or remarks to improve it or fix any issues. The code is for demonstration purposes and therefore not optimised for large data sets.

## Dependencies
All the code is dependent on `numpy`. Other libraries are used in the notebook:

 - `pandas` for managing data frames
 - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualisations
 - `sklearn` for basic preprocessing and metrics

## Examples
There are two Jupyter notebooks. One tries to replicate the `tf.keras.Sequential` model and the other the Functional approach.
